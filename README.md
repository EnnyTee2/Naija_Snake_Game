# Naija Snake v1.0 :snake:

## This repository contains a snake game built as part of the portfolio project requirement for the ALX Software Engineering Programme.
Development work is presently ongoing on the gameplay and interface.
                                                                                                                                 
## Description :bulb:
The game draws inspiration from a very popular game - "Snake Xenzia" which was originally shipped with first generation cell phones made by Nokia Corporation.
The game is built with the Python programming language, precisely Python 3.
