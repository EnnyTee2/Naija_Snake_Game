# Naija Snake v1.0

## This repository contains a snake game built as part of the portfolio project requirement for the ALX Software Engineering Programme.
Development work is presently ongoing on the gameplay and interface.

The game draws inspiration from a very popular game - "Snake Xenzia" which was originally shipped with first generation cell phones made by Nokia Corporation.
The game is built with the Python programming language, precisely Python 3.
